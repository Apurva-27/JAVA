<!--
canvas.getContext():--

1. The canvas is initially blank.

2. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. 

3. The <canvas> element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions. 

4. Checking for support
	1. The content is displayed in browsers which do not support <canvas>.

	2. Scripts can also check for support programmatically by simply testing for the presence of the getContext() method as shown below.

	if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    }
	else {
		// deal with old browsers
	}
